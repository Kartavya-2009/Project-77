        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
<br>             Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.</p>

<p>The Console screen is used to do some type of trial which will not be visible to the user.
     We can open the console screen by doing a left click on the screen and then click on the Inspect button then it will open. </p>
